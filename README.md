This project explores the application of statistical models on time series forecasting. We used SARIMA and ARIMA
forecasting models to predict a dataset containing six months of web traffic data for each hour of every day. The code
was written in R programming language and an extensive report was uploaded with the project. The project was
completed in a team of 2 students.
